# Recommendation Engine with IBM
This project created various types of recommendation systems to recommend articles to both new and returning users, based on real data from the IBM Watson Studio platform.

## What I did
Exploratory data analysis

Used descriptive statistics and visuals to understand the dataset
Clean up the dataset
Rank-based recommendation for new users

Created functions to recommend most popular articles
User-user based collaborative filtering for existing users

Created functions to recommend articles based on what similar users liked
User-item based collaborative filtering for existing users

Implemented singular value decomposition (SVD) to recommend articles based on the history of user-article interactions
Trained SVD on training set and evaluated performance on testing set.
